To create a post-fix notation calculator in racket.

Hello! Here is my post-fix calculator implemented in racket using a list as a stack
The top of the stack is the last value in a list, with the bottom being the first item.
I tried my best to implement this using the either monad to handle any errors, Im unsure if I did it entirely correctly, but am happy with the result.
